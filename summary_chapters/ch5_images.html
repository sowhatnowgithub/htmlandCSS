<hr />
<dl>
    <dt><b>src :</b></dt>
    <dd>This is an attribute for img tag which has the relative or absolute URL path to the image</dd>
    <dt><b>alt :</b></dt>
    <dd>THis is an nessary attribute which is used by browser to identify the image and also for screen readers,<br /> even if image has no value, we should still add src and in quotes leave it empty</dd>
    <dt><b>title : </b></dt>
    <dd>This gives info about the images, if mouse pointer hovers over it</dd>
    <dt><b>width :</b></dt>
    <dd>This is an attribute to set width</dd>
    <dt><b>height :</b></dt>
    <dd>This is the attribute to set height</dd>

<img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="pink roses" title="Bunch of pink roses" cite="https://pexel.com" width="300" height="400"
/> <br />

<p id="block_inline_elements">Images are shown in one of three ways bases on where img are set</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Block Elements</dt>
    <dd>This means that the after every tag(block) like h1 or p there are always start after a new line</dd>
    <dt>Inline Elements</dt>
    <dd>This means that the tags are in between a tag for example b(bold) or i(italic) or em are usually in the p <br />which means these contents do not start with a new line rather the remainingg text or data adjusts them selves for these</dd>
</dl>

<p>Examples for Block Elemnts</p>
<hr />
<img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="roses"  height="100" />
<p>This is how the text appears at a new element</p>
<p>Examples for Inline Elements</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="roses"  height="100" />
    This is how the images is shown</p>
<hr />
<p>This is the image <img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="pink roses" height="100"/> is shown</p>
<hr />

<h3 id="align">align</h3>
<p> The align attribute is now removed in html5</p>
<p>This is usually used as Inline elements cause the text is flown with respect to the value of the attribute of align</p>

<dl>
    <dt>align=left</dt>
    <dd>This align entire text to the right of the image </dd>
    <dt>align=middle</dt>
    <dd>This will make the first line of the text in the middle of image and text is on right of the image</dd>
    <dt>align=top</dt>
    <dd>This will make the first line of the text in the top of the imagee and remaing text is below the image</dd>
    <dt>align=bottom</dt>
    <dd>This will make the first line of the text in the bottom of the imagee and remaing text is below the image</dd>

</dl>
<hr />
<p><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="pink rose" width="100" align="left"/> this is now more good, cause the image is oreinted towards left <br/> and the pink rose is now more good</p>
<br />
<hr />
<p><img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="pink rose" width="100" align="middle" />the seed-bearing part of a plant, consisting of reproductive organs (stamens and carpels) that are typically surrounded by a brightly coloured corolla (petals) and a green calyx (sepals).</p>
<hr />
<br />
<p>the text appearing with respect img <img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="pink rose" width="100" align="top" /> cause the next text will be below the image <br /> </p>

            <li><b>jpg's, gif's, png's</b> these are example of <b>bitmap</b> which means these are made up of a lot of miniature squares</li>

            <li><b>Vector Images</b>: These are completely different from <b>bitmap</b> images, as these are formed by joining lines between two points</li>
