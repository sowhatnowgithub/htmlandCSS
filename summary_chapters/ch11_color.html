            <h2>Color</h2>
            <div class="color">
                <p>In <em>CSS3</em> there are <em>three</em> way of defining color</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>RGB values</b></li>
                    <li><b>Hex</b></li>
                    <li><b>color name</b></li>
                    <p>Ex:<a href="images/img18.png" alt="Image of css syntax on how to define colors" target="_blank" class="image">Screenshot</a></p>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="color_types">
                <p>These are some of the properties of colors</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Hue</b>: Hue is near to the colloquial idea
                        of color. Technically speaking
                        however, a color can also have
                        saturation and brightness as
                        well as hue.</li>
                    <li><b>saturation</b>: Saturation refers to the amount
                        of gray in a color. At maximum
                        saturation, there would be no
                        gray in the color. At minimum
                        saturation, the color would be
                        mostly gray </li>
                    <li><b>brightness</b>: Brightness (or "value") refers
                        to how much black is in a color.
                        At maximum brightness, there
                        would be no black in the color.
                        At minimum brightness, the
                        color would be very dark.</li>
                    <li><b>contrast</b>: Ex: <a href="images/img19.png" alt="image showing the variation of contrast with visual example" target="_blank">Screenshot</a></li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div  class="hsl">
                <h2>CSS, HSL and HSLAcolors</h2>
                <p>Hue, Saturation, Lightnesss<br> Ex: <a href="images/img20.png" alt="image showing the definition of these" target="_blank">Screenshot</a></p>
                <p><q>a</q> stands for <em>alpha</em>: This is expressed as a
                    number between 0 and 1.0.
                    For example, 0.5 represents
                    50% transparency, and 0.75
                    represents 75% transparency.</p>
                <p>Using <b>hsl and hsla</b> property, Ex: <a href="images/img21.png" alt="using hsl property" target="_blank" >Screenshot</a></p>
